# Springboard Mini-Projects

### Summary

The Springboard Data Science Career Track course involves completion of a number of "mini-projects", exercises designed to build and demonstrate knowledge of a variety of tasks required for a career in Data Science, including data sourcing and wrangling, data visualization, exploratory data analysis, statistical evaluation, and machine learning. This repository contains the output of each of these mini-projects.

### Contents

The repository contains a folder for each mini-project. They are as follows:

<ul>
    <li><b>API</b> - An exercise using the Quandl API to demonstrate requesting data through API calls.</li>
    <li><b>EDA_human_temperature</b> - Performance of exploratory data analysis and statistical comparions to evaluate whether normal human body temperature is 98.6 degrees.</li>
    <li><b>EDA_racial_discrimination</b> - Utilization of both the frequentist and bootstrap methods to statistically evaluate whether job applicants with white-sounding names are more or less likely to receive a callback than those with black-sounding names.</li>
    <li><b>clustering</b> - Unlabeled classification of customer data to evaluate and categorize a marketing campaign. K-means clustering was used, and evaluations of the clusters were evaluated using PCA and the silhouette method.</li>
    <li><b>hospital_readmit</b> - An exercise creating a statistical analysis of hospital readmission data and evaluating outside conclusions on hospital readmission data.</li>
    <li><b>linear_regression</b> - An evaluation of the determinants of housing price, using items expected to determine housing prices as the regressors and housing prices as the regressand.</li>
    <li><b>logistic_regression</b> - Utilization of logistic regression to evaluate whether a person can be classified by his or her sex based on height and weight.</li>
    <li><b>naive_bayes</b> - A text analysis to determine which words are most commonly associated with "fresh" rotten tomatoes reviews. This allows reviews to be classified based on analysis only of the text that they contain.</li>
    <li><b>sliderule_json_exercise</b> - An exercise designed to demonstrate familiarization with data in a JSON format.</li>
    <li><b>sql_poject</b> - SQL code used to demonstrate skills in aggregation, filtering, subqueries, and other skills in SQL.</li>
</ul>
